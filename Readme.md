# Utils for jq
Useful functions to use in jq.

## How to use?
To have jq functions directly when you type them in the terminal, make sure you have
the tool installed, and then create a .jq file in the $HOME directory.
So in the file whose path would be `$HOME/.jq` the content of the file `utils-jq.jq` is 
copied

## About
While working with jq i realized that there are some functions that are not built in and that is why i had to create several functions that i plan to add here as I think of them. i hope it will be useful to you and above all it will save you time like me: v.

# Functions
  * repeat($N):  
    repeat an object N number of times.
