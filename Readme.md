# utils-jq.jq

Useful functions for jq

## What is it?

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a great tool for query processing on JSON files, 
the [utils-jq.jq](https://github.com/manuel-chinchi/utils-jq/blob/master/utils-jq.jq) file
found in this repository contains several functions in `jq` syntax that can be used within 
your custom queries.

## How to use?
To have jq functions directly when you type them in the terminal, make sure you have
the tool installed, and then create a .jq file in the $HOME directory.
So in the file whose path would be `$HOME/.jq` the content of the file `utils-jq.jq` is 
copied
